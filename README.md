### 🖖 Live Long and Prosper 🖖


<h4> My name is Vanessa and I’m still a Biologist  🐠  🌴  🐼  , passionate about tech   💻  that decided to adventure into the Coding World <br> and optimize my professional framework with some awesome programming skills as a Junior FullStack Developer  👩🏻‍💻  <br>
I’m also a responsible && creative free-spirit   🦄  , that loves to travel  ✈️  and get involved in the local cultures, addicted to Sci-fi movies/books  👽  🛸  , photography (nature && street photography) 📷 , and an assumed && proud 'cat-lady' of two fat Siamese <br> cats 😸 <h4>
